## Project Overview: 

This project demonstrates a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) automation framework using Cucumber integrated with Selenium WebDriver and Page Object Model(POM).
It is designed for scalable, maintainable and efficient UI test automation.


## Features:

**BDD with Cucumber:** Implements Gherkin syntax for feature files to define test scenarios in plain language.

**Page Object Model (POM):** Separation of test scripts and UI elements for better maintainability.

**Custom Step Definitions:** Simplifies mapping Gherkin steps to Selenium actions.

**Hooks Implementation:** Provides preconditions (before hooks) and postconditions (after hooks) for test execution.

**Data-Driven Testing:** Supports parameterized testing using examples in feature files.

**Parallel Execution:** Executes multiple scenarios concurrently to optimize execution time.

**Cross-Browser Testing:** Runs tests on multiple browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

**Integration with Jenkins:** Configured for CI/CD pipeline integration.

**Detailed Reporting:** Generates execution reports using ExtentReports.
